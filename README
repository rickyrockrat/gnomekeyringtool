This is a command line tool for managing Gnome keyring for Gnome Desktop.
Originally developed and provided as part of CollabNet Subversion command line
client binaries for Linux and Solaris. This is useful when you need to use
the keyring in an environment without a GUI such as an SSH terminal session
into a remote server.

This was forked by rickyrockrat to add several nice features.

Added -b, 
Changed -i so it is verbose 
Use keytool -t to see the list of keychains. 

To see verbose info about a keychain (i.e. the items on it) 
keyring_tool -i keyname 

usually keyname is login 

To change all passwords matching a certain password: 
keyring_tool -b keyname 

You will be prompted for old and new (new twice) passwords. It will then search through the passwords, only changing ones that match old. 


You can follow the development and history of this tool on:

This project also contains the moz-gnome-keyring-integration that has been modified to work
on older versions of gnome-keyring (think RedHad).

Refer to the Git History (SVN no longer updated):
